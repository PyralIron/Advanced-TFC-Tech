# Advanced TFC Tech
The experience of a textile weaver is that of a hard-worker. He sits at the loom all day, holding down right click (though for those skilled few they may man multiple looms at once), persisting each day to produce a humble amount of fabric. However, for some this is simply not enough. For some conjure dreams of vast production chain of textile production, the sum of which producing a hundred times the output of a single weaver - but the poor loom cannot suffice.
